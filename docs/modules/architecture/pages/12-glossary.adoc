|Term |Definition

|*GGUF*
|GPT-Generated Unified Format - A binary format for storing quantized large language model weights. Successor to GGML format.

|*Quantization*
|Technique to reduce model size and memory usage by using lower-precision numbers (e.g., 4-bit integers instead of 32-bit floats).

|*K-Quants*
|Advanced quantization methods (Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, etc.) that use mixed precision for better quality/size tradeoff.

|*KV-Cache*
|Key-Value cache used during LLM inference to store computed attention values, avoiding redundant calculations.

|*Token*
|A unit of text processed by an LLM. Typically a word, part of a word, or punctuation mark.

|*Vector API*
|Java API (JEP 338) for expressing vector computations that compile to optimal SIMD instructions on supported CPUs.

|*SIMD*
|Single Instruction, Multiple Data - CPU capability to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.

|*AVX-512*
|Advanced Vector Extensions with 512-bit registers - Intel CPU feature for high-performance vector operations.

== Protocol & Framework Terms

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Term |Definition

|*MCP*
|Model Context Protocol - A standard protocol for AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources.

|*MCP Server*
|A service that implements MCP to expose tools (functions) that AI assistants can call.

|*MCP Client*
|An AI assistant (like Claude) that connects to MCP servers to use their tools.

|*Tool*
|In MCP context, a function exposed by a server that clients can invoke with structured parameters.

|*Stdio Transport*
|Communication channel using standard input/output streams, typically for process-to-process communication.

|*JSON-RPC*
|Remote Procedure Call protocol using JSON for message encoding. Used by MCP.

|Term |Definition

|*Kotlin Multiplatform*
|Kotlin feature allowing code to be compiled for multiple platforms (JVM, JS, Native) from shared sources.

|*Expect/Actual*
|Kotlin Multiplatform mechanism where `expect` declares a platform-agnostic API and `actual` provides platform-specific implementation.

|*Source Set*
|In Kotlin Multiplatform, a directory containing source code for a specific platform (e.g., `jvmMain`, `commonMain`).

|*Coroutine*
|Kotlin's concurrency primitive for asynchronous programming without callbacks.

|*Flow*
|Kotlin's cold asynchronous stream type for emitting multiple values over time.

|*Mutex*
|Mutual exclusion primitive in Kotlin coroutines for protecting shared state.

|*Fat JAR*
|A JAR file containing all dependencies bundled together for standalone execution.
