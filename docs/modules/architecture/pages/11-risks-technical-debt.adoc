== 11.1 Technical Risks

[cols="1,2,2,2,1"]
|===
|ID |Risk |Impact |Mitigation |Priority

|TR-01
|*JDK 21+ Requirement*
Java Vector API is incubator module, may change
|Breaking changes in future JDK versions
|Abstract SIMD operations, monitor JDK roadmap
|Medium

|TR-02
|*Model Compatibility*
GGUF format evolves, new quantization methods
|Models may not load correctly
|Pin tested model versions, version detection
|Medium

|TR-03
|*MCP Protocol Changes*
MCP is relatively new, spec may evolve
|Integration breaks with Claude updates
|Use official SDK, monitor protocol changes
|Low

|TR-04
|*Performance on Low-End Hardware*
LLM inference is CPU-intensive
|Unusable on older machines
|Document requirements, provide lightweight mode
|Low

|TR-05
|*Large Model Downloads*
Models are 4-8GB
|Poor first-run experience
|Provide download scripts, progress indicators
|Low

=== Debt Details

[cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
|ID |Debt Item |Current State |Remediation

|TD-01
|*CLI Implementation*
|`Main.java` prints "Hello, World!"
|Implement argument parsing, wire to GitClient and LLMSummarizer

|TD-03
|*MCP standup_summary Tool*
|Not implemented
|Add tool combining commits + LLM summarization

|TD-04
|*Platform Implementations*
|Return empty lists
|Implement or clearly document as unsupported

|TD-05
|*Logging*
|Minimal, inconsistent
|Add SLF4J throughout with configurable levels

|TD-06
|*Error Handling*
|Silent failures in GitClient
|Add proper error propagation and user-friendly messages

== 11.4 Improvement Roadmap

=== Short Term (Next Release)

* [ ] Implement `standup_summary` MCP tool
* [ ] Add streaming support to MCP responses
* [ ] Improve error messages

=== Medium Term

* [ ] Complete CLI implementation
* [ ] Add integration tests
* [ ] Unify configuration approach (env vars vs system properties)

=== Long Term

* [ ] Native platform support (beyond stubs)
* [ ] HTTP transport option for MCP
* [ ] Model management tooling
